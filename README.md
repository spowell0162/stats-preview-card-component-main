### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was the first time that I used a mobile-first workflow. I originally had some trouble with the image overlay but figure it out by using mix-blend-mode.

### Continued development

Responsiveness is the main thing I want to continue working on. The design works well with the given dimensions from the style guide, but could be improved.
